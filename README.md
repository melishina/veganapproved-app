# VEGAN APPROVED ITEMS
**Challenge:** Ingredients in products is hard to understand<br>
**Goal:** Make it easier for people with special diets to find out if they can eat/buy a product or not

For a costumer with special diets it can be hard to know what you can buy or not in the grocery store. You often need to check the index of the product to know if it's contains substances from animals, if it's nut, soy or gluten free. The labels of 'vegan-approved' products mean different for different labels. Some believe that exclusion of animal substances is necessary, while others consider that production and good working conditions as important parts of its veganism.

Based on this knowledge, it was a better idea to have people add their conditions that were important to them.

The app gives you the power to scan, browse or enter the products name. You also have the option to browse products that you have already approved so you can go to the store with an idea already in mind with what you want to buy. Product research just became so much easier!
